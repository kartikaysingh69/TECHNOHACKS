## Project Overview
The TECHNOHACKS(Data Analytics) is a series of tasks aimed at cleaning and analyzing a dataset. This provides instructions on how to perform data cleaning, calculate summary statistics, and create pivot tables using the dataset.

## Task 1: Data Cleaning
In this task, we will clean the dataset by removing missing values and outliers. Follow these steps:

1. Load your dataset into a suitable data analysis tool (e.g., Python with pandas).
2. Identify and handle missing values:
   - Use functions like `dropna()` or imputation techniques to deal with missing data.
3. Identify and remove outliers:
   - You can use statistical methods or visualization tools to identify outliers and remove them as needed.

## Task 3: Visualization using Histogram
In this task, we created a histogram or bar chart to visually represent the distribution of data in the dataset.

1. Selected one or more variables from the dataset to visualize.
2. Utilized a plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create a histogram or bar chart.
3. Analyzed the distribution patterns and drew insights from the visualization.

## Task 4: Pivot Table
In this task, we will use pivot tables to summarize data in the dataset. Pivot tables are helpful for aggregating and presenting data in a structured manner. Follow these steps:

1. Load the cleaned dataset.
2. Create pivot tables using tools like pandas in Python or equivalent tools in other software.

## Getting Started
To get started with this, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A dataset to analyze.
- A data analysis tool or programming environment (e.g., Python, R, Excel).
- Required libraries or packages (e.g., pandas, numpy) installed if you are using Python.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/kartikaysingh69/TECHNOHACKS.git)
2. Follow the instructions for each task mentioned above.
3. Customize the code and analysis to fit your specific dataset and requirements.
